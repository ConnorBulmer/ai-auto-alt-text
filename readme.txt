Automatically generates alt text and image titles for your WordPress media uploads with GPT-4o mini, improving accessibility and SEO.

== Description ==

**AI Auto Alt Text Generator** is a lightweight, privacy-conscious plugin that uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini vision model to create meaningful, screen-reader-friendly alt text and SEO-friendly titles for your images. Whether you add a single image, bulk-process your library, or just want a one-click fix in the Media Library, the plugin handles it all – no manual effort required.

This solution is far cheaper than many alternatives because it cuts out the middle-person. You’ll just need to bring your own OpenAI API key.

### ✨ Key features

* **Automatic alt text on upload** – set-and-forget accessibility.
* **Optional automatic image titles** – improve SEO with descriptive titles.
* **One-click manual generation** – “Generate Alt Text & Title” button in the Media Library.
* **Bulk update tool** – batch-process existing images (five at a time) with a configurable pause between batches.
* **Prompt fine-tuning** – supply site-wide context and optionally include the image file name.
* **Image size & detail control** – choose the resolution and level of visual detail sent.
* **No extra servers** – data flows only between your site and OpenAI; nothing is stored off-site.
* **Multilingual output** – choose English (UK), English (US) or other popular languages. (English US is the default.)

### 🧭 Where to find the bulk tool

* **Tools → Bulk Alt Text Update**
* **Media → Bulk Alt Text Update** (shortcut that redirects to the Tools page)
* **Settings → Alt Text Generator** includes a button linking straight to the bulk page

### 🧠 How it works

1. When an image is uploaded (or manually chosen), the plugin creates a temporary public URL for that image.
2. It sends the image – plus optional context such as the parent post title, your custom site context and the file name – to OpenAI’s *gpt-4o-mini* vision model.
3. GPT-4o returns a concise description.  
   * Alt text is stored in WordPress’ native `_wp_attachment_image_alt` field.  
   * (Optional) The returned title is stored as the attachment post title.
4. Nothing is cached or stored on OpenAI’s side; only the final strings live in your database.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/ai-auto-alt-text-generator` **or** install via **Plugins → Add New**.  
2. Activate the plugin.  
3. Go to **Settings → Alt Text Generator**.  
4. Enter your OpenAI API key, configure your preferences, and save.

== Settings overview ==

* **OpenAI API Key** – Required to connect to GPT-4o.  
* **Image Size to Send** – Thumbnail, Medium, Large, or Full.  
* **Image Detail Quality** – ‘Low’ or ‘High’.  
* **Site Context** – Optional free-form prompt guidance (brand voice, niche, etc.).  
* **Send Image File Name** – Include file name in the prompt for extra context.  
* **Automatically Generate Title** – Add descriptive titles alongside alt text.  
* **Use full context for image titles** – When enabled, title generation includes site context and file name (uses more tokens).  
* **Bulk optimiser delay (seconds)** – Pause between five-image batches during bulk runs.  
* **Output Language** – Default English (US). Choose English (UK) for British spellings or another popular language; outputs (alt text and titles) will be generated in the selected language.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What data is sent to OpenAI? =  
The publicly accessible image URL, plus any optional context you enable: image file name, site-wide context, and the parent post/page title.

= Does OpenAI store my images or text? =  
No. The OpenAI API returns a response and does not retain your data. The plugin itself stores only the generated alt text and title in your WordPress database.

= Can I customise the prompt? =  
Yes – via **Settings → Alt Text Generator** you can add site context and choose whether to include the image’s file name or parent post title. You can also select an output language; English (US) remains the default.

= Which model do you use? =  
GPT-4o mini vision model (`gpt-4o-mini`) as of April 2025.

= Who can access the bulk tool? =  
By default, the bulk page requires the `manage_options` capability (typically Administrators). You can change this in code to `upload_files` if you want Editors with media permissions to run it.
