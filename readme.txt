Automatically generates alt text and image titles for your WordPress media uploads with GPT-4o mini, improving accessibility and SEO.

== Description ==

**AI Auto Alt Text Generator** is a lightweight, privacy-conscious plugin that uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o mini vision model to create meaningful, screen-reader-friendly alt text and SEO-friendly titles for your images. Whether you add a single image, bulk-process your library, or just want a one-click fix in the Media Library, the plugin handles it all ‚Äì no manual effort required.

This solution is far cheaper than many alternatives because it cuts out the middle-person. You‚Äôll just need to bring your own OpenAI API key.

### ‚ú® Key features

* **Automatic alt text on upload** ‚Äì set-and-forget accessibility.
* **Optional automatic image titles** ‚Äì improve SEO with descriptive titles.
* **One-click manual generation** ‚Äì ‚ÄúGenerate Alt Text & Title‚Äù button in the Media Library.
* **Bulk update tool** ‚Äì batch-process existing images (five at a time) with a configurable pause between batches.
* **Prompt fine-tuning** ‚Äì supply site-wide context and optionally include the image file name.
* **Image size & detail control** ‚Äì choose the resolution and level of visual detail sent.
* **No extra servers** ‚Äì data flows only between your site and OpenAI; nothing is stored off-site.
* **Multilingual output** ‚Äì choose English (UK), English (US) or other popular languages. (English US is the default.)

### üß≠ Where to find the bulk tool

* **Tools ‚Üí Bulk Alt Text Update**
* **Media ‚Üí Bulk Alt Text Update** (shortcut that redirects to the Tools page)
* **Settings ‚Üí Alt Text Generator** includes a button linking straight to the bulk page

### üß† How it works

1. When an image is uploaded (or manually chosen), the plugin creates a temporary public URL for that image.
2. It sends the image ‚Äì plus optional context such as the parent post title, your custom site context and the file name ‚Äì to OpenAI‚Äôs *gpt-4o-mini* vision model.
3. GPT-4o returns a concise description.  
   * Alt text is stored in WordPress‚Äô native `_wp_attachment_image_alt` field.  
   * (Optional) The returned title is stored as the attachment post title.
4. Nothing is cached or stored on OpenAI‚Äôs side; only the final strings live in your database.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/ai-auto-alt-text-generator` **or** install via **Plugins ‚Üí Add New**.  
2. Activate the plugin.  
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Alt Text Generator**.  
4. Enter your OpenAI API key, configure your preferences, and save.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What data is sent to OpenAI? =  
The publicly accessible image URL, plus any optional context you enable: image file name, site-wide context, and the parent post/page title.

= Does OpenAI store my images or text? =  
No. The OpenAI API returns a response and does not retain your data. The plugin itself stores only the generated alt text and title in your WordPress database.

= Can I customise the prompt? =  
Yes ‚Äì via **Settings ‚Üí Alt Text Generator** you can add site context and choose whether to include the image‚Äôs file name or parent post title. You can also select an output language; English (US) remains the default.

= Which model do you use? =  
GPT-4o mini vision model (`gpt-4o-mini`) as of April 2025.

= Who can access the bulk tool? =  
By default, the bulk page requires the `manage_options` capability (typically Administrators). You can change this in code to `upload_files` if you want Editors with media permissions to run it.
